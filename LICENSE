The file "wordlist.cs" was largely derived from the The GSL General Service
List, which is available under Public Domain from http://jbauman.com/gsl.html
This one file is released under Public Domain.  Three modifications were made
to the word list, other than reformatting for use in programming: The
single-letter words "a" and "I" have been removed, and the word "FALSE" was
changed to "false" so there are now 2,282 words in the list, and all are 
lowercase.
